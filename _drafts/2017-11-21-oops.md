There are moments in our lives where we really _nail_ it on our predictions. For me, this usually occurs in the realm of NCAA March Madness brackets and that one time I played fantasy football. I've also been known to arrive at the airport with _just_ enough time to make it to my flight before the gate closes.

Those moments - aye, I cherish them and yea, they pleaseth the Lord.

Then there are those _other_ times where, due to circumstance or a bad batch of shrimp in my Papalote burrito or whatever else, my predictions and reflections can be a bit off sometimes. Unfortunately, this also tends to occur with things far more impactful than a sportsball bracket.

And it takes me to some rough places. I even [wrote about this](http://mattschaar.com/clay/) only a few months ago:

`The signals of a job loss may come earlier than you imagine; you have the choice whether to leave. “I didn’t know” has become an all-too often mantra for me after a handful of life setbacks or stuck-in-the-mud moments, but it’s not a satisfactory excuse for experiencing them when so much is available to prevent the situation from occurring.`  

I was reflecting on a particularly dark moment - it was real, and it was authentic. But I suppose one of the things I failed to do in that moment was take it in context.

And context, as they say, is everything. Like an omitted Oxford comma, ignoring context can turn a meaningful and helpful step toward progress into a pit of despair.

Take the statement above. The top layer of the onion suggests that _all_ is bad, and there is a universal diligence that we must all undertake to prepare for setbacks. Be diligent at all times, perhaps.

God, I make a shitty prophet.

Gandhi, a sage just _slightly_ wiser than me, had something to say about despair and fear:

`“When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it--always.”`

As the sun starts to set on 2017, I've been fortunate to emerge a bit from that cracked, clay-fired pot I wrote about this summer to put things into greater context:

- I've run more this year than any year prior, and as I approach my 37th year, the fact that my leg hasn't fallen off yet is something to celebrate.  

- The year started with a breakup, followed immediately by what amounted to one of the [more amazing and rejuvenating journeys](http://www.clifbar.com/article/the-love-bus) I've taken in perhaps my entire life. _Note: this ragtag group took two journeys this year._

- I participated [in](http://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon.aspx) [three](https://www.tcsnycmarathon.org/) [events](http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/) that most humans would be overjoyed to even _observe_ just one. I got to do each one with a cadre of amazing humans alongside me, and sometimes even in front of me. (Paddy, you're fast.)

- I have healthcare. See the first bullet above as to why that came in handy.

- I have the means and resources to keep on this torrid pace of exploring the world and make good on my promise to continue doing some _good_ in society, and I'm inching ever closer to understanding what that looks like.

- I'm loved. And others let me love them back.

- I now have someone in my life who embodies that on a daily basis. She's taught me a glorious amount about myself with a dash of Bostonian charm, grit, and honesty.

There's so, so much more to be scribbled down. Yet I save those for another time, in a moment where I'm finding the world seems to be at an impasse.

And perhaps that prediction this summer was accurate after all. In the last line, I wrote:

`It’s not always going to be okay. And that’s okay.`

True. True.
