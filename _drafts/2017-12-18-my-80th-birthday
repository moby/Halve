- It'll be in a place of reverence and honor for me. Somewhere that feels familiar, one with a degree of comfort and safety while also having a degree of significance for me in terms of impact (could it be somewhere like the Headlands where I've run a bunch of trails? Would it be somewhere that I launched my political career? Or would it be something else?)
- Who would be there: people representing the various stages of my life. Regardless of whether they were close friends or simple were impacted by my work or personhood, they would be present.
- The party would consist of space for gratitude...not just directed toward me, but giving me the opportunity to show thanks to others for their impact in my life.
- If I would be totally honest...it would be big. Like, Kennedy Center big - and not because it held a bunch of people who had a degree of superficial connection to me, but it was the only place that could hold the number of people that impacted me (and vice versa).
