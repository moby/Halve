- It'll be in a place of reverence and honor for me. Somewhere that feels familiar, one with a degree of comfort and safety while also having a degree of significance for me in terms of impact (could it be somewhere like the Headlands where I've run a bunch of trails? Would it be somewhere that I launched my political career? Or would it be something else?)
- Who would be there: people representing the various stages of my life. Regardless of whether they were close friends or simple were impacted by my work or personhood, they would be present.
- The party would consist of space for gratitude...not just directed toward me, but giving me the opportunity to show thanks to others for their impact in my life.
- If I would be totally honest...it would be big. Like, Kennedy Center big - and not because it held a bunch of people who had a degree of superficial connection to me, but it was the only place that could hold the number of people that impacted me (and vice versa).
- The speech I give is short but impactful. Here's how it may sound:
    "Friends, loved ones, and those who probably have found me insufferable at times,
    I don't address you as someone who has somehow figured out everything there is to know and understand, especially in each of the areas where we've met.
    No, the reason we're here is because, despite how long it took for me to finally figure this out, I spent the past forty years devoting my time and energy to a few very specific things, and through a combination of good fortune, patient and loving support from you all, and a bit of elbow grease, we're here to tonight to celebrate.
    I don't like to think we're here to celebrate me, despite me reaching this milestone age that has become commonplace in the West and a sign of wisdom in the East. No, I want us to talk about what we did together.
    See, about forty years ago, after a tumultuous experience of global experiences, failed relationships, and a few early departures from companies in my twenties and thirties, something changed in me. I became...well, bored with the things that appeared to be what was desirable for an educated man to do: go to school, get a steady job, get married and have 2.4 kids. This aspiration hasn't really changed much between generations, you see, and there's also nothing inherently wrong with it. I still believe that my marriage and our children are our greatest work, and I couldn't be more humbled nor proud to have them, and my wife, by my side.
    But what came more clear to me was a mandate I felt compelled to uphold: a LEGACY of sorts.
