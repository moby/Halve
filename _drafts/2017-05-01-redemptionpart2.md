It should come as no surprise that this second post took a few months to complete...or even start, really.

Coincidentally - or perhaps even ironically - I lost my job two weeks after I drafted up [Part One](http://mattschaar.com/redemption-part-1/) of this missive. The timing wasn't lost on me.  

Instead of vamping on that experience in much detail, I'll just point out something I mentioned in my previous post:

>...imagine if that spouse or friend held a secret - or revealed a side of themselves that caused conflict. Or, suppose you simply grew apart to a point where healing and regrowth would be actually more painful and dangerous than letting the wound stay exposed.  

This is a recurring theme that I've found in a variety of spaces. While I originally pointed it in a direction reflecting on my time in the Evangelical Christian community, it's sprouted up in friendships, workplaces, and - not surprisingly - relationships. And with each experience, I've discovered a very common theme: *I'm willing to suffer.*  

My therapists and I have worked backwards to understand where this penchant to persevere stems from. A few sources emerged:

- *My six-month battle with cancer.* Getting a few liters of poison pumped into your veins, I suppose, teaches you a thing or two around how much you're willing to tolerate.
- *Parents who persevered.* My dad went through job losses and health setbacks, checked himself into rehab, and still continues to face personal challenges to this day. My mom's in the same boat; yet, they choose daily to enter the ring of life and duke it out in necessary fashion.
- *And, a self-victimization complex.* Back in fifth grade, when the teasing got worse, my little ten year-old brain attempted to deconstruct all the reasons why
