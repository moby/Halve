If you're clued into Silicon Valley, you understand that it's a lot like high school. By that, I mean that food is served in a singular, centralized location across a scattered campus, and the smartest people in the room are usually a few years younger than you. Damn kids.  

Oh, by that, I *also* mean that spicy news travels quickly. As is such, this past weekend presented the opportunity for the Bay Area zeitgeist to sink its teeth into another - yes, *another* - account of Uber's continued struggle with maintaining a semblance of respect for humanity itself.

Susan Fowler - whom I might add, is an incredibly talented and accomplished [speaker, author, and developer](https://www.susanjfowler.com/about/), recounted her experiences working at a fledgling transportation company - er, ahem, a "[digital service](http://venturebeat.com/2016/11/26/uber-seeks-ec-ruling-that-it-is-a-digital-service-not-a-transportation-company/)" - that is likely having its Harvard Business School case being written about it this very moment. In her [post](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber), she describes a particularly unique working environment. We can break down a few particular elements of dysfunction:

- Inappropriate communications from a manager to an employee - or, really, two employees regardless of position
- Complicity on the part of HR
- Giving employees ultimatums
- HR personnel withholding key information central to an employee's personal satisfaction
- Battle Royale Politics

....I saw more, but I frankly got exhausted documenting all of this.  

Susan's experience for *anyone* would be harrowing and unacceptable. However, what made this particular situation notable is that it occurred 1) to a company with a particular history of [bad behavior](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-hobica/5-very-good-reasons-why-i_b_5406643.html) by drivers and [executives alike](https://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists); and 2) to a woman, a particular segment of the technology personnel base empirically shown to have systemically faced discrimination within an industry known for skyrocketing careers for those who tough it out.  

As soon as I read Susan's post on Sunday morning, I shared it with a woman whom I know has faced her own share of discrimination (she works at a tech company focused on transforming a legacy industry as well). Her response was succinct in purest form:

*"That's awful, but not at all surprising."*

The reactions I've seen amongst many friends of mine falls into either her category - or is one of genuine shock. The latter usually occurs amongst friends who are detached from the Bay Area cocoon and, thusly, are unaware of the massive upheavals we've seen around gender and racial equality in the industry. Many of their own industries face similar pangs of unfair treatment, but the thrust of social media and self-diagnosed global importance has placed the technology sector in the very middle of this discussion.

However, there is a *third* reaction emanating from the corners of society that needs to be confronted: one in which Susan's story is dismissed or diminished, or feigned objectivity is introduced. One such example came in this response on a friend's Facebook posting of Susan's article:

There are other notable comments across the spectrum that take on a similar note of victim shaming/blaming, diminishing the credibility of the victim, etc. etc.
