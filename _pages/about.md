## Hey. I'm Matt.

I'm a guy who likes to talk and write about things related to one of the following topics:

- Technology
- Politics
- Gender equality
- Trail running
- Heartbreak
- Religion
- College football
- and Relationships.

Basically, I'm the worst person to bring to a party, because I'm just bound to bother someone about something. Glad you're here.
