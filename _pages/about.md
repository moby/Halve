## Hi, I'm Matt.

I’m an amateur ultramarathon runner and coffee enthusiast with 15 years of experience as a product marketing leader, technical product manager, and consultant across multiple industries. Each phase of my work has mixed deep technical insights, strategic thinking, and customer engagement both internally and externally, all with a goal of making products for a world in need.

Here are a few examples of the work I've done. For more lengthy details, you can have a glance at my [résumé](https://github.com/schaar/schaar.github.io/files/3220561/Schaar_ResumeMay2019.pdf).

### Product

Technology's impact on the world is still nebulous: neither good nor bad, destructive nor beneficial. I aim to lean on the right side of that history, and I've helped bring products like the [Civis Platform](https://www.civisanalytics.com/civis-platform/), [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres), and [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprise) to the marketplace.

### Business Strategy

Having founded several businesses on my own, I've brought those experiences to a broad and far-reaching client base such as [The Skillman Foundation](https://www.skillman.org/), [Imprint](https://imprint.us/), [LiveRamp](https://liveramp.com/), and the [World Food Programme](https://www1.wfp.org/). I've built plans to help companies raise money, enter new markets, become more efficient, and explore technology in new ways.
